\usage{
test_continuous_date(dat, index, form = ymd, granularity = "days")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame to test}

\item{index}{index of column containing dates}

\item{form}{a lubridate function giving the format the dates should be in}

\item{granularity}{how often are measurements expected? defaults to \code{'days'}.}
}
\value{
returns at least some of the missing dates (measured in \code{granularity}) if there are any, otherwise returns TRUE
}
\description{
Determine whether date column contains a continuous range of times
}
\details{
by "some of" the missing dates, we mean the function returns the first [\code{granularity}] after the one present in the dataset. However, more than just the first unit might be missing.
